<h2 align="middle">Project Milestone</h2>
<p>Our goal is to create a survival game in Unity with realistic visual effects, melee combat, and animations. Due to switching from our original project proposal, we still have several features to complete our polish before final submission.</p>

<p> We have currently implemented a custom script to produce a day-night cycle, taking advantage of Unity's capacity for realtime global illumination. We have a reflection probe and custom water shaders to implement realtime reflections and realistic water. We have completed animations for attacking, sprinting, and remaining idle, as as well as a script to handle smooth transitions between them. Our melee combat uses raycasting from a first person camera to determine distance to targets and whether they lie in combat range.</p>

<p>Slide and video links here.</p>

<p>Future features include: realistic models, water shader animations, wind effects, cloth simulation, procedural terrain generation using perlin noise sampling, and more polished shaders and animations.</p>
